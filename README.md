# Overview of UFO Project
In this project, we are looking to display large amounts of data surrounding UFO sightings. We will create a webpage to allow users to filter our data around specific UFO sightings.

## Results

Our webpage will be a great tool to other users allowing them to quickly find data they are looking for within such a large data set. By adding all of these filters around our data set, users to our webpage will be able to search for very specific data quickly. 

For instance, a user may be looking to identify all UFO sightings in California that had a 'light' shape to see if there is any pattern in where these sightings are occuring. By narrowing the full data set to a mangeable data set a user can look at - there are more insightful things the user can look into. As seen in the example below, there are several comments surrounding the UFO sightings on January 1st that mention "three red lights".

With this interesting bit of information, the user can adjust the filters to remove the "shape" filter and enter the date of "1/1/2010" to see if there were other reported sightings with these same comments. In review of the example below, we can see there were many other sightings with other reported shapes that saw the "three red lights".

With this information the user can dive deeper into their investigation to determine if this reported data leads to a false sighting or not.


## Summary 

As I look back on the completed project, there is at least one drawback of this website design. The biggest drawback in this design is that all of the filtered fields are a text field. A user must know the exact spelling and case sensitivity to use that data within the search filters. An example of this would be a user entering "CA" for the state abbreviation, which would return no results as the data is all lowercase.

My first recommendation to further enhance this webpage, would be to make all of the search filters dynamic in nature with all of the possible choices as results in a drop-down filter. This would allow users to choose the data they are looking for explicitly, rather than have a potentially bad experience if they spelled a term wrong or used capitalization.

My second recommendation to improve the search tool would be to extend the date filter functionality to search between two dates. This enhancement will allow users to look for trends in the data across time, as the current implementation only will return data on a specific date.
